<h1>1981</h1>
    <br>
<p>Motley Crue formed in Los Angeles, Calif. in January of 1981. Sixx left a band he had been involved with at the time and connected with Lee. The duo had originally recruited guitarist Greg Leon before finding and hiring Mars. Lee knew Neil, who was singing for a band called Rock Candy at the time. When Neil left that band, he reached out to Lee, and Motley Crue were born. They played their first show in April of '81 at the Starwood Nightclub in LA.</p>
    <br>
<h1>1982</h1>
    <br>
<p>Motley Crue self-produced and released their debut album Too Fast for Love in November of 1981 on their own label, Leathur Records. A&R rep Tom Zutaut later discovered the band playing live, and they ended up signing a contract with Elektra Records in early '82. Too Fast for Love was re-released by the label in August.</p>
    <br>
<h1>1985</h1>
    <br>
<p>Following the success of Shout at the Devil, things definitely started to get a little wild in the Crue camp. There were tensions within the band, especially following Neil's stint in jail, and Sixx started developing a heroin habit. They released Theatre of Pain in 1985, and it showcased their transition away from heavier rock to a more glam-based style. Hit single "Home Sweet Home" paved the wave for future rock ballads, proving that emotional songs had a place in heavy music. Their cover of Brownsville Station's "Smokin' in the Boys Room" became their first Top 20 hit.</p>
